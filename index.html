      either to the participants in the discourse or to something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse.”</p>

        Donald Trump as president is unique in the way he uses social media like Twitter to express his opinions. Unlike Obama, it seems that Trump composes <strong>almost all of his tweets himself</strong>
        and that is clearly demonstrated when he <strong>uses the pronouns "I" or "me"</strong>. However, his tendency of favouring the <strong>'interpersonal'</strong> in his tweets emphasises to his supporters that he will be 
        the one <strong>enacting on the solutions to issues</strong> like gun control, while simultaneously putting his <strong>'enemies' in a negative light</strong>.

        According to an <a href="https://theconversation.com/i-analyzed-all-of-trumps-tweets-to-find-out-what-he-was-really-saying-154532" target="_blank">article</a> by Misha Ketchell, it 
        explains how <strong>Trump is a storyteller</strong>, which helps build a <strong>high level of loyalty from his supporters</strong>; <strong>divert attention from negative topics</strong> and <strong>set the agenda for American public discussions</strong>. 
        There are 5 main themes:
        <ol>
          <li>The true version of the United States is beset with invaders;</li>
          <li>Real Americans can see this;</li>
          <li>I (Trump) am uniquely qualified to stop this invasion;</li>
          <li>The establishment and its agents are hindering me;</li>
          <li>The U.S. is in mortal danger because of this.</li>
        </ol>
        Thus, Trump's narrative approach in his tweets follow these themes, many originating from when he <strong>takes aspects of sources such as articles and videos</strong> and puts his <strong>own version</strong> out there for his loyal followers to see, 
        which is why <strong>many seemed ill-informed</strong>.

        For most successful politicians, the way they garner support can be linked through how they convey themselves in their speeches
        or in this case tweets. Barack Obama and many others rely on the <strong>use of collective language such as "we" and "us"</strong> to make their <strong>supporters feel involved</strong> and <strong>demonstrate
        that it is for the interest of the people</strong>. According to a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3806781/" target="_blank">research study</a> published in 2013 
        on the use of such language by leaders, they found that:
        <ol>
          <li>The use of the word "we" relates to a significant index of these leaders in gaining a following.</li>
          <li>Leaders act as <em>entrepreneurs of identity</em> which defines what they mean by "we" and "us", and also builds a sense of 'one-ness' among current and potential followers.</li>
          <li>Thinking and acting as a collective rather than individual shows capability in mobilising follower support for their leadership.</li>
        </ol>
        Therefore, it's clear that the narrative approach Obama has presented himself is as a president who <strong>views any issues that the U.S. may have</strong> like gun violence as a <strong>collective problem</strong>. 
        Moreover, he seems to have an <strong>appropriate balance of expressing empathy during tragic occurrences</strong> like mass shootings and <strong>expressing his stance on 
        legislations and policy</strong>.<br><br>
